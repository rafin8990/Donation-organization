        <p> If you donate something,these people take some feed for one time. This is very important thing to feed them.Cause they are also our brother.</p>
        <p>One study suggests that we are less likely to want to help groups because people find the needs of larger groups to be emotionally overwhelming. To prevent these emotional costs, people tamp down their emotions and numb their compassion and sense of connection to members .</p>

            They need us to survive
         </h1>
         <p> They are now helpless.They are too much lonely.if we do not help them ,they become very loneliness,So we have to help them everyspare in our life.We have let the forces of capitalism, state-domination and patriarchy run amok. The ever-growing chasm between the rich and the poor allows the elite to run for their well-stocked nuclear bunkers, hoping they can escape the virus, while half of humanity wonders how it will get its next meal if it can not earn its daily wage to buy it.</p>
